# Project Title: Push Data to Excel using Python
# Abstract:
The "Push Data to Excel using Python" project aims to create a Python program that takes input for roll number and name from the user. Upon receiving the input, the program displays a success message and stores the provided data in an Excel sheet. The project demonstrates how to use the openpyxl library in Python to interact with Excel files and efficiently manage data storage in spreadsheets.

This project provides a practical example of data collection and organization using Python, enabling users to save and manage data in a structured format for further analysis and record-keeping.

# Preview:
